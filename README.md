# DEVEMU_FMC_MIPI_Emulator_card
Project Repo for FMC Card Specially Designed for MIPI emulation 

- This breakout Give you 3x MIPI Connections using just HMC LPC Pins.
- Board Specifically Designed for MIPI Emulation. Has Very special Powered and 2x Passive connector.
- Board is specifically for MIPI TX/RX for DSI Display and Camera, While Also has Dedicated Emulation Connector to Emulate Camera RX and Display Emulation.
- Current limited Active Powered MIPI  Connector.
- Passive MIPI Connector for emulation with Powered Detect LED Indication.
- This Board Has 3x 22Pin 0.5mm Pitch 4Lane MIPI Connector, Same As Raspberry Pi 5 onwards.
- Compatible to all Raspberry Style Cameras, 2 Lane and 4Lane cameras and displays for Both TX and RX.
- Compatible Standard 2Lane Rapsberry Pi 15Pins 1mm Pitch Cameras using RPI to Mini FPC Cable.
- Compatible to Digilent PCam  cameras.
- Example Video ISP pipeline working under Linux as V4L2 medica driver on ZCU102 and ZCU106 Provided as Reference example.
- Normal FPGA FMC Board comes from big manufacturer, Availability of such board is very very rare.
- Board is VITA57.1 Compliant Has EEPROM to Configure voltages.
- This is Rev D of Board, Works with ZCU106 and ZCU104, ZCU102
- Both ZCU106 and ZCU104 are supported by Free Xilinx Vivado
